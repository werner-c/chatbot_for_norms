    "Question": "Why is it preffered to place cables in conduits?",
    "Anwser": "Placing cables in conduits is preferred because it has a principle advantage that the cable placement operation is separated in time from the actual conduit construction phase. Moreover, the protection of the cable with the passage of time and the possibility of repeated access, cable removal and delayed cable installation make the method of placing cables in ducts more attractive. The method, however, has a disadvantage in that the initial cost of conduit construction is expensive. It is noted that underground ducts are prone to being deformed by the burden of earth pressure, which makes it necessary to check the ducts before cable installation, and to repair defective ducts before placing cables in conduits.

This method also allows for the protection of the cable with the passage of time, repeated access, removal, and delayed installation, making it more attractive despite the initial expensive cost of conduit construction. Furthermore, underground ducts are prone to deformation by earth pressure, which requires checking and repairing defective ducts before placing cables in conduits.

Hydrogen can react with glass to create irreversible absorption peaks (type 1) that add to the optical loss or interstitial molecular hydrogen that can be present in the glass adding to the attenuation (type 2) [b-Lemaire]. Both mechanisms are of concern in deployed optical cables, as they can add to the overall attenuation of the optical cable.",

With a tighter core pitch, one of the obvious benefits is a higher spatial/core density.\"\nContext 0: \"In the random coupling regime, SMD increases in proportion to the square root of the transmission distance, so the RC-MCF is expected to reduce the accumulated modal dispersion to less than that in the FMF.\"\nContext 0: \"Random coupling can result in a lower mode-dependent loss (MDL) / differential modal attenuation (DMA) and lower nonlinearity, which in turn simplifies the calculation complexity in the MIMO-DSP.\""
